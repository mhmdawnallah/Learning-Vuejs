My journey of learning Vue js in 2-3 days time frame

Important concepts to know in Vue js:
- **Vue Instance**: the main Vue object that represents an application, and contains data, methods, computed properties, and more.
- **Template**: the HTML-based syntax used to define the structure and content of Vue components
- **Props**: custom attributes that can be passed to a component to configure its behavior and data.
- **Data**: the reactive state of a Vue component that updates the view when changed. Computed Properties: cached properties that are computed from the component's data, and can be used to reduce code duplication and improve performance.
- **Methods**: functions that can be called from the template or other methods, and can modify the component's data or trigger other functionality.
- **Watchers**: functions that watch for changes in the component's data, and can perform additional logic or side effects when a change occurs.
- **Directives**: special attributes in the template that allow you to apply dynamic behavior to HTML elements, such as v-if, v-for, and v-bind.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: methods that are called at specific stages of a component's lifecycle, such as mounted, updated, and destroyed, and can be used to perform initialization, cleanup, or other actions.
- **Events**: a system for communication between components, where a child component can emit an event that the parent component can listen for and respond to.
- **Filters**: functions that can be used to transform data in the template, such as formatting dates or filtering lists.
- **Mixins**: reusable code snippets that can be shared across multiple components, and can include data, methods, computed properties, and more.
